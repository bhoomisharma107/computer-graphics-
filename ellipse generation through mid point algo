Algorithm
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare rx , ry , x , y , m , dx , dy , P , P2.

Step 3: Initialize initial point of region1 as

                 x=0  ,   y = ry

Step 4: Calculate P= ry2 + rx2 / 4 - ry rx2  

                               dx = 2 ry2 x

                               dy = 2 rx2 y        

Step 5: Update values of dx and dy after each iteration.

Step 6: Repeat steps while (dx < dy):

            Plot (x,y)

             if(P < 0)

             Update x = x+1 ;

             P += ­ ry2 [2x + 3 ]

             Else

              Update x = x + 1

                           y= y - 1

Step 7: When dx ≥ dy, plot region 2:

Step 8: Calculate P2 = ry2 ( x+1 / 2)2 + rx2 (y -1)2- rx2ry2

Step 9: Repeat till (y > 0)

               If (P2 > 0)

                Update y = y-1        (x will remain same)

                              P2 =­ P2 -2 y rx2 + rx2

                 else

                 x = x+1

                 y = y-1

                 P2=­ P2+ 2 ry2 [2x] -2 y rx2 + rx2

Step 10: End

Advantages:

The mid-point ellipse algorithm has simple and easy implementation as it only includes addition operations.
Disadvantages:

This algorithm is time consuming.
